Welcome to the first edition of the contents of my mind with your host triz, enjoy.
=====================================================================================================================================
Ever experienced periods of time where you just feel like you're existing and nothing can be known for certain, as I write this it's 
one of those nights. Every so often I just find myself in the mood to turn the lights off and walk around my pitch black room with
my earbuds in playing music. I just kinda enjoy the mood of the music and don't think about much else. It's basically just wasting
time until I'm too tired to be awake, essentially just waiting for tomorrow when I'll be feeling better or worse. I was doing that before
I decided to turn on my computer so I could sit down and write this. Wow, putting in effort to share this little portion of my life
with you, dear reader, I hope you can appreciate that. Anyways it's an odd feeling, it's not sadness at all but it's not happiness 
either, it just kinda existing. A way to describe it would just be feeling ordinary or unremarkable, I had to look up words for 
that. A word that comes to mind is "bliss" but I think that's too positive for what it really is. Is it a good thing? to take a 
break and totally clear your mind? or is it a sign of issues that you cant even begin to think about, we'll never know. By the way 
the music I'm listening to is a mix of Modest Mouse, Radiohead, Gorillaz, you know the sorts, but it's specifically the mellow 
thought provoking stuff like "Trailer Trash" "How to Disappear Completely" and as I type this sentence "Night On the Sun" I highly 
recommend putting together a playlist of mellow songs for use when feeling like this, or when you're sad, or just need calm music, 
it can be very versatile just depending on what mindset you're listening to the playlist with. One of the few things I can think
of now is the desire to be social and meaningful to people, basically be a good member of society, be seen as a good person with
plenty of personal hobbies and projects and goals that matter and expand into including others in a positive way. Maybe it's just a
desire to be a good person, idk. I'll try to be part of peoples days soon even if in seemingly insignificant ways, just be good.

Peace is both calming yet worrying. Music is powerful. Thats my 2 cents for now. Goodnight reader.
